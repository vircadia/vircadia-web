### Customization Options

The web client's settings such as branding, default servers, and more, can be customized directly from [environment variables](https://github.com/vircadia/vircadia-web/blob/master/quasar.conf.js#L131) which you must set at or prior to build/compile time.

See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://v2.quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js) for a full set of customization options.
